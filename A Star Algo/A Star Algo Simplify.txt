1: Firstly, Place the starting node into OPEN and find its f (n) value.

2: Then remove the node from OPEN, having the smallest f (n) value. If it is a goal node, then stop and return to success.

3: Else remove the node from OPEN, and find all its successors.

4: Find the f (n) value of all the successors, place them into OPEN, and place the removed node into CLOSE.

5: Goto Step-2.

6: Exit.
